# BlockAddr iOS App

Checks BTC balance, total sent BTC, and total received BTC of a public address

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The [Expo XDE](https://expo.io/tools) can be installed to run the project from your local machine. If it is not installed, you can also use [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io) to run and test the code. Simply copy and paste the App.js code into the Snack IDE and copy any component classes and their dependencies into the file above the App class. You can find an example of what this would look like [here](https://snack.expo.io/?session_id=snack-session-SkeOGQoXRZ).

Regardless of whether you are using Expo Snack or the Expo XDE, you will need the Expo app on your iOS or Android phone downloaded in order to run the app.
